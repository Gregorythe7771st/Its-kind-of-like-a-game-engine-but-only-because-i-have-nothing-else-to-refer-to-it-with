this is some frankly garbage code(it was made in one singular day) that runs a senary(base 6) programming language which i call senlang.

the basic math operations are normal(+, -, /, *, **)

round [num]
rounds the number to an integer

random
Gets replaced with a random number

print [code/anything else]
prints the thing

not [bool]
[bool] and [bool]
[bool] or [bool]
the respective logical operations

[num] > [num]
[num] < [num]
[num / bool] == [num / bool]
[num] >= [num]
[num] <= [num]
they do their thing it should be obvious

var [name] = [value / code]
sets up a variable

set [name] = [value / code]
changes the value of a variable

goto [line]
changes the line the program is on to the line

if [expression] goto [line]
if the expression is true it changes the line the program is on to <line>

/# [comment]
(ignore the slash i had to add it so github didn't do its styling)
comment. gets skipped.(make sure you seperate the # from what you will be typing)


do not put a semicolon at the end of a line, the program does it for you(you can if you really want but you'll just be wasting it's time)
