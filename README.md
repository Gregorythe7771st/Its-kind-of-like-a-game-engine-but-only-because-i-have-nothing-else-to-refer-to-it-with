this is some frankly garbage code(it was made in one singular day) that runs a senary(base 6) programming language which i call senlang. (this is currently in the process of being rewritten to hopefully make adding new features easier, so don't expect many updates)

the basic math operations are normal(+, -, /, *, **, //, %)
(no order of operations)
(parantheses do work)

round [num]

rounds the number to an integer


random

Gets replaced with a random number


print [code/anything else]

prints the thing


not [bool]

[bool] and [bool]

[bool] or [bool]

the respective logical operations


[num] > [num]

[num] < [num]

[num / bool] == [num / bool]
[num / bool] != [num / bool]

[num] >= [num]

[num] <= [num]

they do their thing it should be obvious


var [name] = [value / code]

sets up a variable


set [name] = [value / code]

changes the value of a variable


goto [line]

changes the line the program is on to [line]


if [statement] then [expression]

if the statement is true it runs [expression]


/# [comment]

(ignore the slash i had to add it so github didn't do its styling)

comment. gets skipped.


stop

stops the program you're running


You dont need to put a semicolon at the end of a line, the program does it for you.
